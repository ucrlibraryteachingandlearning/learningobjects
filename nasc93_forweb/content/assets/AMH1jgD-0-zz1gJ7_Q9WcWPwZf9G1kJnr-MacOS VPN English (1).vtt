Hi! I'm Jesse and this is how I got set up with free remote access to all the

2
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.120
e-books and articles provided by UCR Library using VPN on my Macbook. First,

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.150
let's talk about why we need to use VPN from off-campus. When you're off campus

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.470
websites don't necessarily know that you're a Highlander. This means that if

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.720
you try to access an e-book or article in a database or on a website, you might

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.130
not be able to get the full-text, you might get an error message, or the

7
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.850
website may even ask you to pay a fee. Don't pay that fee! To see if you can get

8
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.210
that book or article through UCR Library, you can set up your computer

9
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.789
with VPN. This gives you a chance to type in your UCR login ID and show the

10
00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.010
internet that you're a Highlander! Once you are set up, you'll have access to

11
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.320
millions of resources paid for by UCR Library. This includes ebooks, articles,

12
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.060
videos, music, and all sorts of things. Here's how I did it. First, I went to the

13
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.880
library website at library.ucr.edu. Under "using the library" and under

14
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.970
"technology and equipment", I clicked on connect from off-campus. To choose VPN, I

15
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.130
clicked "follow these instructions". I use a Macbook so I chose MacOS. After that,

16
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.220
I followed these directions to get set up. Let's walk through it together.

17
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.640
For more information on how you can get set up with remote access to everything

18
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.920
UCR Library has to offer, visit library.ucr.edu and click on

19
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.030
"connect from off-campus"
