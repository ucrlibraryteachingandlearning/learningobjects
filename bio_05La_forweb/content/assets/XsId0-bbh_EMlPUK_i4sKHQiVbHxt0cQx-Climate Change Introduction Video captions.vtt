00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.532
Yep, it’s official. We’re all going to die.

2
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.266
Hey, what are you all doing?

3
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:22.399
Oh, I’m just planning my bucket list before the world ends in 10 years.

4
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.566
I want to visit Hawaii before it goes underwater from rising sea-levels.

5
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.666
Where are you getting this information from?

6
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.999
It’s in the news.

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.566
I saw it on my feed.

8
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:46.333
UNBELIEVABLE

9
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:53.566
If you all really care about climate change, you both need to properly inform yourselves about it first.

10
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:58.099
You shouldn’t believe everything you read and hear. Did you even check the credibility of

11
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.133
those news sources? Or even look for related scientific articles on the topic?

12
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.566
We need to think more like scientists.
