1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.820
UC Library Search is

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.840
a multi-layered discovery tool designed to search print,

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.405
digital materials and many other types

4
00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:11.760
of resources at UC Riverside,

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.160
other UC Libraries and beyond.

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.900
UC Library Search can be searched using

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.305
the general search boxes on the Library's website,

8
00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:24.480
or can be accessed directly using

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.640
the UC Library Search link in

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.670
the popular link section on the library homepage.

11
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.195
Searches using the general website

12
00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:37.924
search boxes are treated as keywords.

13
00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:40.925
You can also try and search for specific titles,

14
00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:45.600
names of authors, specific journals, and more.

15
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.000
Searches using the general website search boxes,

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.355
search various other library resources

17
00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:53.690
in addition to searching

18
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.955
UC Library Search.

19
00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.735
When you go to UC Library Search for the first time,

20
00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:02.360
you will see several reminder messages,

21
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.830
such as signing into

22
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.700
your library account and signing on to the campus VPN.

23
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.325
When you are signed in to your library account,

24
00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:13.010
you will see all the features and options available to

25
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.550
you depending upon your affiliation to UCR.

26
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.670
In addition, signing into the campus.

27
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.620
VPN will allow you to see

28
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.930
all the different materials available through

29
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.300
our license and subscribed resources.

30
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.530
Clicking on the SEE ALL link from

31
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.080
the general search results page will

32
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.435
go directly to UC Library Search

33
00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:37.760
and by default search the, "Articles,

34
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.995
books, and more..." search profile.

35
00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:42.740
Note, again, the reminders to sign

36
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.620
into your library account as well as the VPN

37
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.180
if you're off-campus.

38
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.785
When you sign into your library account,

39
00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:55.774
you'll be prompted to login using your UCR credentials,

40
00:01:55.774 --> 00:02:01.020
specific, your UCR net ID, and associated password.

41
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.935
When you are signed into your account.

42
00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:06.845
You will also see your library profile,

43
00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:09.230
what materials you have checked out,

44
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.990
what you have requested at UCR or from

45
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.575
other libraries and many other features.

46
00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:17.930
This is an example of

47
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.540
a simple search in UC Library Search

48
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.609
with the various search profiles

49
00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.310
automatically displayed below the search box,

50
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.650
as well as suggested search words.

51
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.790
And this is an advanced search with

52
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.415
the various search profiles to select from,

53
00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:38.940
as well as additional filters and limit options.

54
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.370
Notice the variety of features and labels to the left of

55
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.410
the screen are facets or filters you

56
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.840
can use to refine your search results.

57
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.600
Other noteworthy features include the "Map it" button,

58
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.095
"save query", "check availability",

59
00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:56.360
and an assortment of other options which

60
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.074
will allow you to save a permanent URL,

61
00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:02.044
send a copy of the citation via email,

62
00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:05.720
save that record to your favorites and more.

63
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.380
This is a typical full display of a book available at

64
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.680
UCR as well as other UC libraries.

65
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.725
Note the full array of "Send to" options,

66
00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:17.510
the "Map it" button and the "Locate"

67
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.745
link provide similar information.

68
00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:22.370
If UCR's copy happens to be checked

69
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.340
out or unavailable for some other reason,

70
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.770
the "Request through Interlibrary Loan" link

71
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.850
would allow you to request

72
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.510
a copy of the book to be delivered to UCR for your use.

73
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.105
The other "Find it" features you might see,

74
00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:37.265
depending upon the items you are interested in,

75
00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:40.100
are "UCR Request" for paging

76
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.280
in an item from the shelves to be placed on hold for you.

77
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.500
"Article/Chapter Scan" to scan

78
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.390
a specific article or chapter from

79
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.559
a book from a physical copy in our UCR collection.

80
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.880
Among the various facets or filters you

81
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.190
can use to refine your search results.

82
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.505
Some of the more useful ones include "Availability",

83
00:04:01.505 --> 00:04:05.945
"Resource Type", "Library", and "UC Libraries".

84
00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:09.035
Take for example, our "Chief Joseph" search.

85
00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:10.550
We could use the "Peer-

86
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.600
reviewed Journals" under Availability facet,

87
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.370
and select "Articles" under

88
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.530
the Resource Type facet and apply

89
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.470
the filters to refine our results.

90
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.650
The records in our brief results list are

91
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.470
now limited to peer-reviewed articles.

92
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.830
Note that in UC Library Search, if available,

93
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.020
direct links to "Read Article" or

94
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.250
"Download PDF" allows you to access the articles directly.

95
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.305
Remember, if you are off-campus,

96
00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:42.140
you must be connected to the campus VPN in

97
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.905
order to access licensed and subscribed resources.

98
00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:48.440
If the "Read Article" or "Download

99
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.575
PDF" links are available and you click on the link,

100
00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:54.200
this LibKey webpage will appear and

101
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.720
should resolve to the article you wish to view.

102
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.775
If there are no obvious direct links to the article.

103
00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:05.060
Look for other links such as "Available Online".

104
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.610
Or click on the title of the item to view

105
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.035
the full display and scan for other online options.

106
00:05:12.035 --> 00:05:15.740
This article has a few potential online options.

107
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.530
The article was published in 2010.

108
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.920
So it should be available from JSTOR.

109
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.100
When searching most library resources

110
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.450
combining keywords and

111
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.575
concepts using connectors such as OR, AND,

112
00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:33.694
and NOT, also known as Boolean operators,

113
00:05:33.694 --> 00:05:35.330
is an effective strategy to

114
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.880
expand or narrow your search results.

115
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.565
Note, the Boolean operators must be in

116
00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:44.285
ALL CAPS when searching UC Library Search.

117
00:05:44.285 --> 00:05:47.345
When building or refining search strategies,

118
00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:49.385
you can also use quotation marks [" "],

119
00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:51.230
to look for an exact phrase,

120
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.300
an asterisk [*] can be used to find

121
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.955
different possible variations to a root word.

122
00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:58.550
You should also group similar keywords and

123
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.160
concepts by using parentheses [ ( ) ].

124
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.030
UC Library Search also has

125
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.895
a dedicated search profile for "Course Reserves".

126
00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:09.920
You can always search for items by using

127
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.860
information such as the title of the book or video,

128
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.230
the author or director, etc.

129
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.405
Another option is to search using

130
00:06:17.405 --> 00:06:18.980
other known information such as

131
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.740
the "Course Instructor" or the "Course ID".

132
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.890
This is a search for items on course reserves for English

133
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.290
001A. Note

134
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.480
the Course Reserves search profile features,

135
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.465
facets for "Course Instructor" and "Course Name".

136
00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:38.600
In addition to your UCR library card

137
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.640
for physical items on course reserves,

138
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.950
you'll need to know which library it's located

139
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.925
at and the call number in order to check out the items.

140
00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:49.580
Some items on course reserves might

141
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.830
also be available in multiple formats,

142
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.410
such as print and ebook. There may also

143
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.440
be more than one copy of the same item on reserve.

144
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.030
Note, the options in

145
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.800
the "Find/Request" section

146
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.780
had been blurred out because items on

147
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.480
course reserves are generally not eligible

148
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.660
to be requested from other libraries outside of UCR.

149
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.399
Finally, some other notable features.

150
00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.440
If you are looking for even more items

151
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.240
beyond UC Library Search,

152
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.940
then you might be interested in searching WorldCat.

153
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.480
WorldCat is another example of a library catalog designed

154
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.960
to find items held by libraries all around the world.

155
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.610
UC Library Search also

156
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.040
features a dedicated "Newspapers Search",

157
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.490
a "Find by Citation" tool and direct access to our

158
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.080
"Ask Us" chat reference service and many other options.

159
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.240
Newspaper articles from

160
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.894
many different licensed and subscribed resources

161
00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:46.219
can be searched from a number of locations,

162
00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:48.215
including from the main menu link.

163
00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:50.090
You can also easily move from

164
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.250
one page of results to the next,

165
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.925
or increase the number of results to display per page.

166
00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:58.970
The default number is ten (10) records per page.

167
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.225
If you're having any trouble using UC Library Search,

168
00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:05.630
