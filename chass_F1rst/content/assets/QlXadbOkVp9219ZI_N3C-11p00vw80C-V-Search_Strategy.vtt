00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.069
Welcome to the UCR library.
I'm Judy Lee one of the librarians at UC

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:19.439
Riverside. This module covers steps to
creating a search strategy. Start your

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.080
plan of action by selecting your topic.
To do that you may want to pull out a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.660
sheet of paper and a pen or pencil to
think about the topic. Some people like

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.760
to use concept maps as they sketch out
their ideas. A couple of these examples

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.219
are seen on the left of the slide. Your
topic should meet the requirements of

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.390
your assignment something to keep in
mind.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.129
Hopefully the assigned topic or one that
you select will be meaningful or have

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.590
interest to you as well. You will break
up your topic into its major components,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.390
then you will identify keywords or
subject terms that relate to those

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.140
components. Be flexible as you conduct
your research be prepared to tweak or

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.820
adjust your topic as you find more
relevant or interesting results from

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.740
your search. You may want to incorporate
what you find as you refine your

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.799
strategy. If you can, consider
alternatives to your original topic as a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:33.540
back-up plan. The general procedure is to
use logical operators as you utilize

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.180
library databases for your search and
that includes the library catalog. These

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.369
logical operators are also known as
boolean operators they will connect the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.240
search terms that lay within each
component of your search, such as

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:58.590
keywords. The operators will also connect
the components of your topic. The most

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.920
heavily used operators are "or" and "and"
how these words are used in the search

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.660
process will be different than how we
use them in conversation otherwise known

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.770
as natural
language. As you can see the boolean

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.490
operator "or" is more it puts together the
terms that represent a component as seen

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.540
in this Venn diagram, "or" can enlarge the
search set of a component the term

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.270
"colleges" and the term "universities" can
be synonyms that represent the same idea.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.350
On the other hand the boolean operator
"and" is less, and links the search

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.660
components together and mandates that at
least one term in each component is

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.300
present in your search results,
"and" will limit the size of the resulting

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.130
set. The results of the search should be
about both colleges and first-generation

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:07.410
students. There are time-saving
additional features that you can add to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.319
your research skills, truncation and
wildcards allow you to say keystrokes by

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.690
using word stems to include their
variations. In these examples

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.110
truncation normally allows for unlimited
truncation while wildcards allow for a

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.350
specific number of characters to vary
within the term. Always check which

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.049
symbols are used for each database or
resource as they can vary, both in the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:44.100
symbol used and how the symbol is
interpreted. Phrase searching is useful

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:52.380
when the exact word order matters in a
multiple word term use the quotes. By the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:00.630
way, the third example saw a coup is the
Korean for four to nine or April 29

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:10.710
which refers to the date of the 1992 LA
Riots. More search

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.440
tips. These frequently found database
features can help you refine your search

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.680
by applying limits or filters to it. In
using a database or resource for the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.780
first time, spend a little time to become
familiar with the features that are

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.680
available to you. Before you head over to
a database to start your search, let's

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.120
step back a little and consider
different types of searches. Just to get

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:49.380
a bit of the bigger picture. Pearl growing
sometimes you can start with a clue or

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.330
one piece of information that can lead
you to other resources. This

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.980
investigative action can grow your
research much like the grain of sand

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.010
into a pearl. For example, you may be
talking to your instructor about your

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.720
topic and she remembers an article that
she came across she gives you the

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.120
citation to it. Even before you track it
down you can also search for this known

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.610
item in a database, if you find it there
the database can provide you with the

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.880
terms that describe the article. Whether
they be in the abstract as keywords or

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.640
possible leads to subject terms.
If specialized vocabulary is involved,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.970
then knowing the language of the
discipline can be important. Also if you

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.240
find a key citation to a work, you can
use citation chaining to your advantage.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.430
So who's cited this resource ? Could it be
that the citing work is also about the

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.680
same topic and that it might be useful
for you? This is another approach to link

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:03.720
forward in time to other items. That is
forward from that original item. Let's

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:11.870
move on, successive
fractions, here's another approach which

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.030
you can think of as researching in
chunks. You can start with a very broad

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.640
topic and narrow it down by scanning the
results and using what you discover to

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.740
refine your search. This way you let the
literature or what's out there

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.680
guide you into refining your topic. It's
one way of researching your way into the

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.650
topic. By the way, if you only have a
general idea of a topic and haven't

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.080
quite decided how to narrow it down
browsing the literature in this way as

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.300
preliminary work is another method to
create a search strategy. In this example,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.350
we start with the very broad topic of
set A= college admissions then based on

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.440
the results we move to a narrower search
in set B=college admissions in public

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.530
universities. Although these results
could still be very large. From there we

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:15.160
can move to the more narrow topic of set
C=college admissions of first-generation

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.650
students in public universities. The next
type of search is what we typically

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.210
think of when we conduct searches and
which illustrate the use of boolean

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:35.120
operators. Building blocks if you have
already identified your topic in its

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.130
components, it is time to put the similar
terms together that represent each

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.900
component then connect the search
components together using the boolean

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:52.160
operators. In this example, we see the
terms used note the use of truncation as

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.910
well as phrase searching in our strategy.
Also note the use of parentheses for

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.720
search component A which is really more
of an exceptional case than the rule.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.100
These parentheses are used for nested
logic which gives you control to

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.380
determine the order of the search
operations. In this case we put together

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:22.010
the concepts of college and admissions
with "and" and

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:30.310
add in the exact phrase "college
admissions" by using "or" to include it.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.390
Databases have search boxes that tend to
work for each component where the terms

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:41.419
are linked together by the same boolean
operator. These parentheses or nested

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:46.970
logic, would allow you to mix the boolean
operators in the same search box to get

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.640
your desired results. What we want here
is the intersection of the three

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:59.980
components or search sets as represented
by that small shaded area in the diagram.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:06.800
Look at the questions in the slide,
what if our results are too small to be

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:14.300
useful or even contain zero results? Well
take heart, this is where you try to be

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:22.130
creative, flexible and have an
alternative plan. In this example, instead

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.660
of the results of the three components
can the intersection of two of the

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:32.600
search components produce results that
you can use. Such as the intersections of

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:42.500
sets A and C or B and C or A and B that
is college admissions and

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:48.010
first-generation students, or public
universities and first-generation

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:55.970
students or college admissions and
public universities. Might some of these

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.960
resulting articles provide you with
evidence that you could use in your

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:06.560
paper? Can you think of other terms to
add to your search? Maybe you can make

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:13.520
one of the search components larger by
adding terms with "or" can you uncover

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.280
other work from one of your researcher
names that might help with your topic?

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:25.520
What about other works from one of the
co-authors? Can you switch out a

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.850
component in your search with an
alternative component that you've

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:34.610
considered? For example, instead of
first-generation students what

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:40.430
if you use other categories of students
such as, undocumented students or

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:51.769
veterans? As you can see the search
process is an evolving one. Your final

00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:58.029
topic for your paper may turn out to be
different from your original topic. Think,

00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:04.490
consider your topic and the terms you
will use. Search, try your search in an

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:11.120
appropriate database for your topic.
Review, examine the retrieved results are

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.220
there useful citations are there
additional terms or other information to

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.160
incorporate into your search strategy?
Refine, incorporate additional

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:29.390
information to revise your strategy.
Research, try out the revised strategy to

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:35.690
see if the search results have improved.
Think about these steps and be prepared

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.130
to dip into a database or resource more
than once as your search strategy

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:51.680
evolves. Maybe that's why it's called
research. Some people think that the

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.750
search process is a straight line, that
one could put search terms into a

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:02.839
database get some results and then be
done. Is this likely to be a perfect

00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:10.430
search? It can happen, depending on how
the search is constructed, but that is

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:16.220
not always the case. Think back about
your own experiences with academic work

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:23.690
or for personal research. We can think of
the research process and the resulting

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:29.120
search strategy as being cyclical over
time. It's really more like a

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:38.839
stretched-out slinky than a direct
straight line. For more information on

your research!
