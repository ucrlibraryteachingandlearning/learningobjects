00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello, my name is Donovan, and I will be assisting you today in this tutorial.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I will be showing you how to access and use Academic Search Complete.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Right now, we are on the library home page.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And what you would want to do to find Academic Search Complete is to

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
scroll down to database right here.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You click on "database" and it will open up a new tab.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And right here, you'll find "Academic Search Complete" on the right hand side.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Some quick information about this database is that it is the place where you can find some information

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
or articles related to any papers you may need or want to write about for your classes.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Before we begin, keep in mind that we need to be using the Global Protect VPN

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
provided by UCR.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Installing the VPN has its own tutorial on the UCR Library website under the section Connect from Off-Campus.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This database is place to find articles you may need for your classes.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'll use college admission as an example topic we can search for in this database.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
As you can see, there are 14,000 results which is of course, far more than what we need for any class.

16
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What you would want to do next is to narrow down your search results

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to something more specific to what you nee for your class.

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We can filter by using the operator "and" to search for more than one search term.

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
As a quick tip, the "and" operator is used to find articles where both search terms are in the article.

20
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The "or" operator means that only one of the search of the search terms needs to be an article

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in order for it to come up in our results.

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We can also put the search term in quotation marks to find only that exact phrasing in our search results.

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In this example, if we use the operator "or" and make our search for California,

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
as you can see, there are 900,000 results which is far more than what we would ever need.

25
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
That is because either term needs to be in the article but you don't necessarily need both terms.

26
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What we would want for this exercise is to use the operator "and."

27
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
By using the "and" operator, we cut down on our search results to only 700.

28
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
700 is of course many many results, but is far less than 900,000.

29
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So another way to narrow down our search results is to use the tool bar on the left

30
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to narrow down to specific sources.

31
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We can refine the search even more by filtering the publication date.

32
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Let's say we want to use article from only about 5 years ago.

33
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We have now refined our search to 140 results.

34
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We can refine our search even further by looking at only peer reviewed sources.

35
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
As a quick tip, a scholarly, peer reviewed journal has to be reviewed by other professionals

36
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
within the same field before it is published.

37
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
A peer reviewed article adds a high level of credibility and trustworthiness to the citations of your paper.

38
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If we refine our search even further to only peer reviewed articles,

39
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we are now down to 37 results.

40
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Let's take a look at one of these results.

41
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
First, take a look at the titles, the authors, the abstract, and the source to make sure

42
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that this is what you would need for your paper.

43
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
As you can see in this article, there are many authors who have contributed to this work.

44
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The abstract is down here, clear an visible and will give you a good summary of what the article is about.

45
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If the article does not fit your need, then of course go back to the results page and look for another one.

46
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
If the article does fit the needs of your paper, you can look at the tools on either side of the page.

47
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
On the left hand side, there is a link to the full text as a PDF, but note that not all articles

48
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
will have a link to a PDF. Some may have an HTML or some may not have a full text available.

49
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Always be aware of if the text you are looking at has a full text available.

50
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The other option is the Get It At UC button. The Get It At UC button will have its own tutorial

51
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that you can watch to get a full explanation of how it works.

52
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
In short, the Get It At UC button brings us to the UCR website where we find some information about the text.

53
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
The tools on the right hand side give you some more additional options that are pretty self-explanatory.

54
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
There are options for sending and saving the page as well as citation generation.

55
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Of course, you should always look at the citation and make sure it follows the format properly.

56
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Of course at the tope, there is a notice saying you should pay special attention to names, capitalization, and dates.

57
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Not all automatically generated citations will be accurate.

58
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
An example of a citation that could use a little bit more work is the Chicago one.

59
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
In the Chicago format, normally you would want the place of publication,

60
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
the actual physical location of the publisher in the citation itself.

61
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And as you can see in this generated example, that is not present.

62
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So for in this example, you would want to add that to the citation when you write the citation in your paper.

63
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Always be sure to check the syllabus to make sure that the citation method is what the professor wants for their class.

64
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you have any questions or concerns, be sure to check the help button and the "Ask a Librarian" button

65
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
at the top of the page for assistance and make sure to follow any instructions that they provide.

66
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Thank you very much for your time, have a great rest of your day, and have fun searching!
