00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.650
In this video I want to talk about the

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.440
UCR catalog. We can use the
catalog to give to books here at UCR. We

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.560
can also use it to get access to
articles, reference articles and more. The

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.910
way to get there is to start from the
library homepage just library.ucr.edu

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.960
and if you scroll down to
the popular the UCR catalog is here. To

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.200
search the catalog, type in your search
in the search box in the light blue bar

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:48.300
near the top so. I'll enter college
admissions I enter it and we get a drop

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.660
down menu below the search box. You can
select college admissions in everything

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.550
this is what gets you the books and
articles. Library catalog is just things

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.270
here at UCR. Our tab and their new one is
course reserves down at the bottom. We

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.390
all know that textbooks are expensive.
And so if your professor puts the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.799
material on reserve, then you will be
able to have access to it. Maybe for a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.290
couple of hours that's plenty of time to
scan the information take it and take it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.770
away with you. So that really is a nice
money saver. I'll scroll up and click on

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.440
everything, and we have 
the results coming in on the right hand

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.260
side in through here. On the left hand
side there are some options you can

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.480
tweak the results by limiting them to just those that

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.750
are available online. So I'll click on
line and apply filters and it's

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.650
returning the results that are
available online. If you find one that

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.340
looks so interesting then the first
thing to do is to open the record. The

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:20.090
reason I like opening the record, is that
at the bottom there is a summary. Of a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.310
subject there's a summary and this is
about a paragraph long description of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.930
what's going on in the article. You can
look at the summary to see whether or

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.880
not it is along the lines of what you
need. If it is then scroll up and there

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.730
is an option to download the PDF right
near the top. So I'll click download pdf

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:53.750
and it goes out and gets the article for
me. With this you can just go you can go

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.100
ahead and download it to your your
device and walk away with the article.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.709
Before you leave the record there is a
really nifty option in the details and

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.450
that's this citation. If you click
citation it will give you the elements

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:20.420
of a citation in MLA APA Chicago
whatever style your your assignment is

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.080
in. You can copy the citation to the
clipboard and then paste it somewhere

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.640
where you have access that way you've
downloaded the article and you've got

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.090
the you've got the elements of a
citation before before you walk away. One

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.989
thing to keep in mind is again to
double-check it for accuracy before you

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.790
turn the paper in. This is just giving
you an idea of what the citation looks

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.900
like it's not necessarily giving you the
final result.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:02.060
I will let's take a look at other things
that we can do with this. With this we

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.850
can, on the resource type you can ask for
different kinds of material. So if you

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.720
know if your assignment calls for a books
we can limit it to just books. And I'm

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.920
going to put my available online
back on.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.850
So here we've got books that are
available online. If there is one that

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:42.220
looks interesting, click the clip the
link. And we see the

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.730
same thing that we saw before. In this case
we can go to eBook central and have

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.280
access to the book since it's available
online.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:02.050
Now one option I really like is that, if
it's available just in print and we're

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.180
able to get into the library
then click map it. What map it will do is

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:16.210
give you a book map that gives you an
idea of where this is located. So this is

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.490
telling us that it's in the Rivera
library, on the second floor, and

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.500
approximately this location down here. Or if
it's too small to see there is some

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.360
really excellent information this line
right here is telling us a shelving role

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.080
name like number in this case 274, I
think and it also has the call number

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.390
down here. So just take a photo of that
take a photo of the map and use that as

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.550
a guide to get to the get to the
resource.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:56.140
One final thing is that right now we are
all closed, and we're not able to get to

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:03.730
the get to the physical book. And so we
are creating a guide of ways that you

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:12.070
can get into a print textbook if if if
it's been scanned somewhere. That's just

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:21.550
under this URL guides.lib.ucr.edu/extracovidaccess. And from

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:28.150
this guy there are places where we can
check and see if a  text book is

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:35.290
available. There are other places other
resources that you can get to for maybe

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.930
not a textbook, but other vendors where
we can get to see whether or not it's

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:48.390
been scanned. So we're using that, keep
checking this site because vendors are

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:55.840
coming in all the time saying yep during
this emergency we can we will make our

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.510
material available. So that's an
introduction to the library catalog we

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.680
can get articles books more stuff to the
catalog.
