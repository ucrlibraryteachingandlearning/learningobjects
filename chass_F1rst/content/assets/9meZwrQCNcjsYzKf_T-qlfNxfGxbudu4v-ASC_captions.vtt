00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.500
My name is Christina Cicchetti. I'm one
of the librarians in the UCR library.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.940
I'm going to give you a brief overview
of searching for articles in one of the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.280
library databases called Academic Search
Complete.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.780
So to get to Academic Search Complete, you can start

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.620
on the library
homepage at library.ucr.edu

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:41.180
Then scroll down to the databases link on the lower right side of the homepage.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.720
Click on the databases link and type in the name of
the database "Academic Search Complete"

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.980
and then just click on the name of the
database to enter.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.100
So academic search complete is a good place to begin
research for many different papers

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.960
because it's an interdisciplinary
database that includes magazines and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.390
journal articles from a lot of different
areas of study meaning that you can find

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.620
something about almost any topic in this
database. So, for example, I'm interested

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.940
in finding information about the college
admissions process, so I can type in the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:34.620
words "college admissions" and click
search and I find quite a number of articles

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.820
a little over 13,000. Now if I
want to be sure that I am searching

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.700
those words as a phrase and not as
individual words, then I can put

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.799
quotation marks around the words and
repeating the search with the quotation

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.909
marks, that reduces the size of my search
results a little bit so that I now have

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.460
a little over ten thousand articles, but
ten thousand results is still a very

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.980
large set of search results. It's really way
more than I'm going to be able to look

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.900
at and evaluate or use.
So when you get really large search

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.180
results like that, that's often a clue
that you may need to narrow down your topic.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.480
So one recent debate in the
college admissions process has been the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.580
role of standardized tests such as the
ACT in the college admissions process.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.050
So I can add the word SAT to my search
boxes and notice that I'm using the "and"

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:55.310
operator between "college admissions" and "SAT" and using that operator tells the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.800
database that I only want to see
articles that include both the phrase

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.200
"college admissions" and the acronym "SAT".

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.380
So if I search again, you can see I've

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.600
really narrowed down my search results.
Now I am down to a little over 500 as

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.980
compared to 10,000 something.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.980
Now another test is frequently used in a similar way

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:35.360
to the SAT and that is the ACT, so if I
want to see articles that talk about

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.680
either one of those tests in the college
admissions process, then I can type "OR ACT"

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:53.300
in the search box along with "SAT" and
using the "or" operator now tells the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.540
database that along with the phrase
"college admissions", I want to see any

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.080
articles that have either the word "SAT"
or the word "ACT".

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.980
They could have both terms, but they don't have to.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.200
So using the "or" operator should open up my search

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.140
a little bit and broaden it and so in
fact, you can see I picked up

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.760
approximately 200 additional articles by
including "ACT OR SAT"

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.070
tests in my search results.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.160
So once you get some search results, you
know kind of scroll through look at the

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.350
titles, the abstracts, and make sure that
you're reasonably happy with the type of

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.420
articles that you're finding, but when
you're reasonably happy with with what

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:58.890
you're seeing, then you can look to the
limit options over here on the left-hand

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.230
side of the screen that gives you some
additional options for narrowing down

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.400
your search results. So notice that down
here in the publication date

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.460
that in this particular set of search results,
my oldest article is

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:27.160
from 1957 and I don't think I want to go
all the way back to 1957.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:36.060
So I am going to limit my results to articles that
have been published in the last five years

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.720
So that leaves me with a 170 articles

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:51.360
Another limit option that you may want to use sometimes you may want to limit your search results to

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.380
scholarly or peer-reviewed journals and
so if you want to do that you can just

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:06.089
click on the button in front of that
option and so now I'm left with 58

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:13.640
articles all from scholarly
peer-reviewed journals or academic journals.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.719
So scholarly peer-reviewed
journals review article submissions with

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:30.749
a panel of experts who work in the same
field as the author and this extra layer

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:34.800
of review means that these journals are
some of the most highly respected

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.740
sources out there.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.880
Another important thing to note about peer reviewed journals is that they mostly publish the original results of

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.820
research, which is not the case with magazines and newspapers.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.380
So the fact that these are research-based, also adds to their credibility.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.520
Using these types of sources will add depth and credibility to your own papers.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:14.340
So the search results page shows me the citation information and the abstracts

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.700
for the articles that I'm finding, along with some subject headings down here.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:28.320
If I click on the title of the article, that will open the full record for me.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.580
So here is the complete record for this first article

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.450
that I have found and notice that
there's a number of tools over here on

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:46.270
the right that I can use. So I could save
this record to a Google Drive. I could

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:53.440
print it. I could email it. I could save
it into a file. There's also a permalink

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:01.930
option here if I want to create a stable
URL that I can use to get directly back

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:12.120
to this record in the database or I can
use the cite tool over here to get a

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:19.900
citation for this particular article in
whatever citation style

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:27.940
I prefer, so oftentimes MLA style, but it
depends on the instructions of your

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:35.530
professor. So once you've selected the
style that you want to use for your

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.900
citations, then you can just copy and
paste that citation into your

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:48.040
bibliography page. Please do note the
caveat up here at the top, to please

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.010
review and make any necessary
corrections before you use the citation.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:09:01.280
That's an essential part of the process,
but it's still a big time-saver over

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.520
building this citation yourself from
scratch.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:19.820
I can also add this record to the folder
that is up here at the top of my search

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:26.860
results page and if I go back to

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:37.480
my full result list, I can add articles
to that folder from this page as well

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.520
by clicking on the little folder icon to
the right.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.860
And that puts all of my selections into
this folder up here at the top of my

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:57.690
results page and now I can print these,
email them, save them, or export them all

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:04.080
as a group instead of having to do them
one at a time, so I can confirm that

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:10.320
indeed, I still want all of the three
articles that I've selected. If I come

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.240
over here and email them, for example,
notice that I do still have the option

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:23.000
to choose a citation format that I would
like to receive along with the article on record.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.440
Please note that when you send things to yourself that all you are

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:42.940
sending yourself is the record and not
necessarily the full-text. If there is a

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:50.730
PDF link to the full text, then you will
get that in your email, but if there's no

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:56.580
full text link that's part of the record, then there's another way that you have to go look for that article

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:04.200
So notice that this first search result does have

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:12.500
a link to the full text of this article
in PDF format so it's very easy to get to it.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.620
The second article has a similar link.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:22.280
Sometimes you might see HTML full text
links instead of PDF

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:29.560
but then there's some articles that don't
have either in a PDF or an HTML link to

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.940
the full article and that's where this
UC-eLinks button comes in.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.580
So I can click on this UC-eLinks button and that's a tool that the library uses to try and

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:47.580
connect to you from the citation and
abstract in one location to the actual

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.240
document itself in another location.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:59.300
So that opens up typically a UC-eLinks menu such as this and this is telling me that

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:06.600
I should be able to get this article from a source called Wiley Online Library.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.900
So if I click on Wiley Online Library

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.940
that takes me into the journal which

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:21.580
originally published this article and
here I do have a PDF link to the article.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:29.740
So keep in mind that if you are not
finding the full text on some other way

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:35.500
make sure you check those UC-eLinks to
see if you can actually get to the article.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:43.000
You will not necessarily find every article in the database in our library holdings.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.320
Although most of the
time, you will find that the library has

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:53.600
holdings for them, but in the event that
we do not have holdings in our library

00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:00.440
you could come down here to the "Request this from the library" link and clicking

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:07.510
on that takes you into our interlibrary
loan and document delivery service and

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:13.640
this allows you to request a copy of
this particular article from another

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:23.300
library that does have the article and
then it would be sent to you typically

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:29.120
when you request an article through
interlibrary loan it will be emailed to you

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:35.540
and you should allow at least three
to five days, sometimes longer, to have

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.340
that filled.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:49.180
So that's a very quick introduction to
using the Academic Search Complete database.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.720
If you have further questions,

00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:01.780
please go to the top of the library home
page, click the "Ask Us" button and there's

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.670
a lot of different ways there that you
can connect with the librarians to have

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.200
your questions answered.
