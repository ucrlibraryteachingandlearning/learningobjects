Hi, my name is Isabel.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I study sociology and this is how I got set up

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with free remote access to ebooks and articles.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
First lets talk about why we need to use VPN from off campus.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
When you're off campus, websites don't necessarily know that you are a highlander.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This means that if you try to access an ebook or article in a database or in a website,

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you might not be able to get to the full text.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You might an error message or the website might even ask you to pay a fee.

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Don't pay the fee.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
To see if you can get that book or that article though the UCR Library.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You can set up your computer with VPN.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This gives you a chance to type in your UCR net id and show the internet that you are a Highlander.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Once you are set up, you'll have access to millions of resources paid for by UCR Library.

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That includes ebooks, articles, video, music; all sorts of things.

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Here's how I did it.

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
First, I went to the Library website at library.ucr.edu

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
then I clicked on connect from off-campus.

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
From there, I chose VPN.

19
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I use a Chromebook so I chose Chromebook browser.

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
After that, I followed these directions to get set up.

21
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's walk through it together.

22
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Now, let's see how this works in action.

23
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Start by searching for your selected resource on the library homepage.

24
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
For this example, I'm going to use the search catalog to search for that book.

25
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Once I selected the book or article, I can click on the UC e-links button, ebook access links

26
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to get to the full text.

27
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It works!

28
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
For more information on how you can get set up with remote access to everything

29
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
UCR Library has to offer, visit library.ucr.edu and click on Connected from Off-Campus.
