Hi, my name is Elias, I'm a computer science major, and this is how I got

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
set up with free remote access to all the ebooks and articles provided by the UCR Library

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
using the Global Protect VPN on my Windows 10 PC.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
First, let's talk about why we need to use a VPN from off campus.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When you're off campus, websites don't necessarily know that you are a UCR student.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This means that if you try to access an ebook or article in a database or on a website,

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
you might not be able to get to the full text, you might get an error message, or the

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
website may even ask you to pay a fee.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Don't pay that fee!

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
To see if you can get that book or article through UCR Library, you can set up your computer

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Global Protect.

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This gives you a chance to type in your UCR net id and show the internet that you are a Highlander.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Once your set up, you'll have access to millions of resources paid for by UCR Library.

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This includes ebooks, articles, videos, music, and all sorts of things.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Here's how I did it.

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
First, I went to the library website at library.ucr.edu.

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Then, at the top of the page, I clicked on Connect from Off-Campus.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
From there, I clicked the link that says "Follow These Instructions."

19
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I use a windows pc, so I chose windows non-managed.

20
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
After that, I followed these directions to get set up. Let's walk through it together.

21
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
For more information, on how you can get set up with remote access

22
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to everything UCR Library has to offer, visit library.ucr.edu and click on Connect from Off-Campus.
