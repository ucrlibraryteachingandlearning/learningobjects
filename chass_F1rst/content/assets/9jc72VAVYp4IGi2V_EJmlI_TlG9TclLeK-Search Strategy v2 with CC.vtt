00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.880
Welcome to the UCR Library. I'm Judy Lee,&nbsp;
one of the librarians at UC Riverside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.840
This module covers steps to&nbsp;
creating a search strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.520
Start your plan of action by selecting your&nbsp;
topic. To do that, you may want to pull out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.160
a sheet of paper and a pen or pencil to think&nbsp;
about the topic. Some people like to use concept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.400
maps as they sketch out their ideas. A couple of&nbsp;
these examples are seen on the left of the slide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.240
Your topic should meet the requirements of your&nbsp;
assignment. Something to keep in mind. Hopefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.440
the assigned topic or one that you select will be&nbsp;
meaningful or of interest to you as well. You will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.840
break up your topic into its major components,&nbsp;
then you will identify keywords or subject terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.720
that relate to those components. Be flexible&nbsp;
as you conduct your research. Be prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.880
to tweak or adjust your topic as you find more&nbsp;
relevant or interesting results from your search.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.000
You may want to incorporate what you&nbsp;
find as you refine your strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:23.840
If you can consider alternatives to your original&nbsp;
topic as a backup plan. The general procedure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.440
is to use logical operators as you&nbsp;
utilize library databases for your search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.520
and that includes the library catalog. These&nbsp;
logical operators are also known as boolean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.360
operators. They will connect the search terms&nbsp;
that lay within each component of your search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.280
such as keywords. The operators will&nbsp;
also connect the components of your topic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.520
the most heavily used operators are "or" and&nbsp;
"and." How these words are used in the search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.440
process will be different than how we use them in&nbsp;
conversation otherwise known as natural language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.600
As you can see the boolean operator "or" is&nbsp;
more. It puts together the terms that represent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.720
a component as seen in this venn diagram. "Or"&nbsp;
can enlarge the search set of a component.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.920
The term "colleges" and the term "universities"&nbsp;
can be synonyms that represent the same idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.880
On the other hand the boolean&nbsp;
operator "and" is less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.440
and links the search components together&nbsp;
and mandates that at least one turn in each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.160
component is present in your search results&nbsp;
and will limit the size of the resulting set.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.840
The results of the search should be about both&nbsp;
"colleges" and "first generation students."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.040
There are time-saving additional features that&nbsp;
you can add to your research skills. Truncation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.840
and wild cards allow you to say keystrokes by&nbsp;
using word stems to include their variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.920
In these examples, truncation normally allows&nbsp;
for unlimited truncation while wildcards allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.760
for a specific number of characters to vary within&nbsp;
the term. Always check which symbols are used for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.760
each database or resource as they can vary both in&nbsp;
the symbol used and how the symbol is interpreted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.840
Phrase searching is useful when the exact&nbsp;
word order matters in a multiple word term.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:48.240
Use the quotes. By the way the third example "sa&nbsp;
i gu" is the Korean for four two nine or April 29,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:57.760
which refers to the date of the 1992 L.A.&nbsp;
riots. More search tips, these frequently found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.960
database features can help you refine your search&nbsp;
by applying limits or filters to it. In using a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.680
database or resource for the first time, spend a&nbsp;
little time to become familiar with the features&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.160
that are available to you. Before you head over&nbsp;
to a database to start your search, let's step&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.680
back a little and consider different types of&nbsp;
searches just to get a bit of the bigger picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.680
Pearl growing sometimes you can start with a&nbsp;
clue or one piece of information that can lead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.080
you to other resources. This investigative&nbsp;
action can grow your research much like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.600
grain of sand into a pearl. For example, you may&nbsp;
be talking to your instructor about your topic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.560
and she remembers an article that she came&nbsp;
across. She gives you the citation to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.840
Even before you track it down. You can also&nbsp;
search for this known item in a database.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.920
If you find it there, the database can&nbsp;
provide you with the terms that describe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.720
the article whether they be in the abstract as&nbsp;
keywords or possible leads to subject terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.000
If specialized vocabulary is involved then knowing&nbsp;
the language of the discipline can be important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.840
Also if you find a key citation to a work you&nbsp;
can use citation chaining to your advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.360
So who cited this resource? Could it be that&nbsp;
the citing work is also about the same topic and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.240
that it might be useful for you? This is another&nbsp;
approach to link forward in time to other items&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.440
that is forward from that original item.&nbsp;
Let's move on, excessive fractions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.640
here's another approach which you can&nbsp;
think of as researching in chunks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.120
You can start with a very broad topic and&nbsp;
narrow it down by scanning the results and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.360
using what you discover to refine your search.&nbsp;
This way you let the literature or what's out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.240
there guide you into refining your topic. It's&nbsp;
one way of researching your way into the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.280
By the way, if you only have a general idea of a&nbsp;
topic and haven't quite decided how to narrow it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.280
down, browsing the literature in this way as&nbsp;
preliminary work is another method to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:31.920
a search strategy. In this example, we start with&nbsp;
the very broad topic of Set A "college admissions"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.040
then based on the results we moved&nbsp;
to a narrower search in Set B&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.440
"college admissions in public universities."&nbsp;
Although these results could still be very large.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:51.120
From there we can move to the more narrow&nbsp;
topic of Set C "college admissions of first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.840
generation students in public universities."&nbsp;
The next type of search is what we typically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.200
think of when we conduct searches and which&nbsp;
illustrate the use of boolean operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.800
Building blocks, if you have already&nbsp;
identified your topic and its components,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.720
it is time to put the similar terms together&nbsp;
that represent each component then connect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:24.000
the search components together using the boolean&nbsp;
operators. In this example we see the terms used.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:32.320
Note the use of truncation as well as phrase&nbsp;
searching in our strategy. Also note the use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:39.040
of parentheses for search Component A which is&nbsp;
really more of an exceptional case than the rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.160
These parentheses are used for nested logic&nbsp;
which gives you control to determine the order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.720
of the search operations. In this case,&nbsp;
we put together the concepts of "college"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:02.640
and "admissions" with "and" and then add in the&nbsp;
exact phrase "college admissions" by using "or"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.440
to include it. Databases have search boxes&nbsp;
that tend to work for each component where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:16.960
the terms are linked together by the same boolean&nbsp;
operator. These parentheses or nested logic would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.800
allow you to mix the boolean operators in the&nbsp;
same search box to get your desired results.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.120
What we want here is the intersection&nbsp;
of the three components or search sets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.200
as represented by that small&nbsp;
shaded area in the diagram.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:41.920
Look at the questions in the slide. What&nbsp;
if our results are too small to be useful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:51.280
or even contain zero results? Well take heart.&nbsp;
This is where you try to be creative, flexible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.560
and have an alternative plan. In this example,&nbsp;
instead of the results of the three components&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.160
can the intersection of two of the search&nbsp;
components produce results that you can use?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:16.960
Such as the intersections of Sets A and C or B&nbsp;
and C or A and B. That is "college admissions"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:23.520
and "first generation students" or "public&nbsp;
universities" and "first generation students"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.320
or "college admissions" and" public universities."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.840
Might some of these resulting articles provide you&nbsp;
with evidence that you could use in your paper?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.840
Can you think of other terms to add to your&nbsp;
search? Maybe you can make one of the search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:48.720
components larger by adding terms with or&nbsp;
can you uncover other work from one of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:56.080
researcher names that might help with your topic?&nbsp;
What about other work from one of the co-authors?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.160
Can you switch out a component in your search with&nbsp;
an alternative component that you've considered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.480
for example instead of&nbsp;
"first generation students,"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:13.920
what if you use other categories of students&nbsp;
such as undocumented students or veterans?

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.160
As you can see, the search&nbsp;
process is an evolving one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.160
Your final topic for your paper may turn out&nbsp;
to be different from your original topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:34.960
Think, consider your topic and the terms you will&nbsp;
use. Search, try your search in an appropriate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:43.280
database for your topic. Review, examine the&nbsp;
retrieved results. Are there useful citations?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.240
Are there additional terms or other information&nbsp;
to incorporate into your search strategy?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.160
Refine, incorporate additional information&nbsp;
to revise your strategy. Research,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.440
try out the revised strategy to see&nbsp;
if the search results have improved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.520
Think about these steps and be prepared&nbsp;
to dip into a database or resource&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:14.400
more than once, as your search strategy&nbsp;
evolves. Maybe that's why it's called re-search.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.920
Some people think that the search process is&nbsp;
a straight line. That one could put search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:28.000
terms into a database get some results&nbsp;
and then be done. Is this likely to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.880
a perfect search? It can happen depending on how&nbsp;
the search is constructed, but that is not always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:44.000
the case. Think back about your own experiences&nbsp;
with academic work or for personal research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.680
We can think of the research process and the&nbsp;
resulting search strategy as being cyclical over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.680 --> 00:12:01.360
time. It's really more like a stretched out slinky&nbsp;
than a direct straight line. For more information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.080
on using the library's resources or your&nbsp;
options for help and research assistant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:14.240
please consult the library's website.&nbsp;
Thank you and good luck with your research!
